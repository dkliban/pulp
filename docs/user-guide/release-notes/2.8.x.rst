Pulp 2.8.1
==========

Bug Fixes
---------

See the list of :fixedbugs:`2.8.1`


Pulp 2.8.0
==========

New Features
------------

* Multiple instances of ``pulp_celerybeat`` can now run simultaneously.
  If one of them goes down, another instance will dispatch scheduled tasks as usual.

* Pulp now supports configuring repositories to download content on-demand when it
  is requested by a client, or in the background after a sync and publish has occurred.
  This feature requires several additional packages and services, and is not supported
  on all content types. As part of this feature we now provide a new package,
  ``python-pulp-streamer``. More information on these alternate
  :term:`download policies <download policy>` can be found in the
  :ref:`alternate download policies documentation <alternate-download-policies>`.

* Several changes have been made to the provided Apache httpd configuration files.
  In addition to these changes, a new Apache httpd configuration file is provided
  by Pulp. This configuration file, ``pulp_content.conf``, is used to configure the
  new WSGI application used to serve content.

* When downloading content, Pulp now uses the system certificate authority trust
  store rather than the certificate authority trust store bundled with
  ``python-requests``.

* Content applicability for an updated repository is calculated in parallel.

Deprecation
-----------

Dependency/Platform Changes
---------------------------

* If run on CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Pulp server now requires either
  version 7.1+ or 6.7+.
* pymongo >= 3.0.0 is now required.
* mod_xsendfile >= 0.12 is now required.

Client Changes
--------------

* Tasks with complete states (except `canceled` state) can now be deleted. This can be done
  using `pulp-admin tasks purge` command.

Other Changes
-------------

* Pulp `used to store WSGI files under /srv <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1496>`_, which was
  a violation of FHS. These files have been moved to /usr/share/pulp/wsgi.

* Pulp platform now automatically calculates the `added_count`, `removed_count`, and `updated_count` fields of repository sync task output.

Agent Changes
-------------

Bugs
----

Known Issues
------------

* CentOS 7 users may experience a problem when upgrading. Please refer to note in upgrade
  instructions for workaround.

* Users that have the `/var/lib/pulp` directory or one of it's subdirectories symlinked will
  experience a `problem <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1791>`_. Replacing the symlink with a bind
  mount will resolve the issue.

Before Upgrade
--------------

The Pulp team added stronger data validation in 2.8. To ensure that your data gets smoothly
upgraded, please test your data with the provided testing tool before attempting an upgrade. You
can read about how to perform the test here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pulp/pulp/pulp-2.8.0-1/playpen/mongoengine/README

Upgrade Instructions for 2.7.x --> 2.8.x
----------------------------------------

.. note::
    When upgrading on CentOS 7, it is possible that your system has 'python-semantic-version'
    package installed. As result you will experience a problem when updating Pulp packages. If this
    package is present on your system you should remove it::

        sudo rpm -e --nodeps python-semantic-version

Upgrade the packages using::

    sudo yum update

After yum completes you should migrate the database using::

    sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db

.. note::
    If using systemd, you need to reload the systemd process before restarting services. This can
    be done using::

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload

After migrating the database, restart `httpd`, `pulp_workers`, `pulp_celerybeat`, and
`pulp_resource_manager`.

Upgrade From Older Release
--------------------------

If you are upgrading from pulp older than 2.4.0, you must first upgrade to some release between
2.4.0 and 2.7.x, and then upgrade to 2.8.0 or greater.

Rest API Changes
----------------

* Tasks with complete states (except `canceled` state) can now be deleted.

* The API for regenerating content applicability for updated repositories no longer returns a
  :ref:`call_report`. Instead a :ref:`group_call_report` is returned.

* Task Groups with tasks having incomplete states can now be canceled.

Binding API Changes
-------------------

Plugin API Changes
